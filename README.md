The input is a long list of integers. Please write a small app that will output the list of
distinct elements sorted in ascending order, plus the basic measurement information
that contains the number of elements in the source, number of distinct elements, min
and max value.
Sample:
For the input:
1 10 20 20 2 5
expected output is:
1 2 5 10 20
count: 6
distinct: 5
min: 1
max: 20

Solution:
I used standard library of Arrays for sorting and combaining distinct elements in array.
